I built a Hotel Booking Analytics dashboard using SQL, Python, and Power BI to analyze booking trends, revenue, cancellations, and customer behavior.
The dashboard includes KPIs, booking lead-time analysis, weekday vs weekend trends, loyalty segmentation, and booking channel analysis.
It helps hotel management make better pricing, staffing, and marketing decisions.”


“Hotels generate large volumes of booking data, but without analytics it’s difficult to understand demand patterns, customer behavior, and revenue performance.
This project helps hotel management answer key questions like:
when customers book, who books, through which channels, and how revenue is impacted.”


🔹 Booking Lead Time
“This chart shows how early customers book their stays.
Most bookings happen within one week, which indicates last-minute demand and helps pricing teams plan promotions.”
🔹 Weekdays vs Weekends
“This visualization compares booking volume across days of the week.
It helps identify peak days and supports staffing and pricing decisions.”
🔹 Customer Loyalty Segments
“This chart shows who stays with us by loyalty level.
We can see that non-members contribute the highest volume, while elite members are fewer but high-value customers.”
🔹 Daily Stay Trend
“This line chart shows the number of stays per day over time.
It helps identify demand trends, seasonality, and peak periods.”
🔹 Booking Channel Analysis (Matrix)
“This matrix shows who is booking through which channel across loyalty levels.
For example, non-members book more via online channels, while loyal customers prefer direct booking or phone, which helps reduce commission costs.”


📌 Data:
“The dataset contains hotel booking transactions including booking dates, stay dates, cancellation status, room revenue, customer loyalty level, booking channel, and stay duration.”
🧰 Tools:
SQL – for extracting and aggregating booking data
Python – for exploratory data analysis and data cleaning
Power BI – for data modeling, DAX measures, and interactive dashboards
